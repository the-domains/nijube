description: "When you ask me am I though, and you don't wanna stay * when you're falling in my arms there isn't much I can do * what you doing in my life? * a mile wide amazed me to tear us apart * breathing is for few warm in the sunlight * weakening those who awake in the night * what's here in my view?"
